# Drumroll
A super simple drumroll sample player for Android.

This is a super simple app I cooked up in a morning, using Android Studio 3 and Kotlin. It consists of a single Activity display a play and stop button, and it just plays an audio file, of a drum roll, as you might've guessed by this point.

## Backstory

I've had this on my TODO-list for a while. Certain trains in Belgium have an automated announcement system, but I found there's something comedic about it. After the line "the next station is", there is a 2.5 second gap before the name of the station is announced. I found that this seemed like they wanted to build the suspense, so next time I'm going over to Belgium and taking that train, I want to prepared with a drumroll to fill that gap.
